              Sinba's mission is to give a new meaning to waste, to ensure that what was once garbage today becomes a vehicle for social and environmental transformation. Sinba is innovating waste management in Peru, converting organic waste into pig feed and maximizing the value of inorganic recyclables in partnership with formal recyclers. Today we collaborate with more than 20 companies and rescue around 840 tons of organic waste per year, which generates a positive impact equivalent to planting 36 thousand trees. But this is just beginning! They want to multiply their positive impact by 10!
